# Chess LSP

Very basic Language Server written in Go that parses a pgn file, reports errors doing so, and suggests legal chess moves as completions.

Created using the [pgn parser by malbrecht](https://github.com/malbrecht/chess) 
Only tested on Neovim.

To read a little more about it, see [my blog post](https://www.sshear.dev/posts/writing-my-own-lsp-in-go/).
